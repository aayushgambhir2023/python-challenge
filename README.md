# python-challenge
In this challenge, I am tasked with creating Python scripts to analyze financial and poll data. I will be working with two datasets, budget_data.csv and election_data.csv. The financial analysis script (PyBank) should calculate the total number of months, net total "Profit/Losses" over the period, changes in "Profit/Losses" with the average, and the greatest increase and decrease in profits. The poll analysis script (PyPoll) needs to determine the total votes cast, list candidates with their respective vote percentages, total votes, and declare the election winner. Both scripts should print the results to the terminal and export them to a text file. As I tackle these tasks, I am encouraged to apply my knowledge of modules, file handling, variables, lists, dictionaries, and iteration. Regularly committing my work and ensuring a detailed README.md file in my repository are essential for a well-organized and backed-up project. The scripts will be tested separately, with particular attention to correctly reading CSV files and accurately printing the required results for each analysis.
